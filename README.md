We have streamlined the source code of the paper into five files, each corresponding to a different data or graphing code for a different figure, as described below.

data_source1.py is the data generation code for Figures 3, 4, 6, and 8, which requires adjusting parameters corresponding to different figures
data_source2.py is the data generation code for Figures 5, 7, and 9, which requires adjusting the parameters to generate data for different curves.
data_source2.py is also the data generation code of Fig. 10, which can be generated by adjusting the ratio of different Omega nodes

fig1.py is the plotting code of Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 8, which requires adjusting the parameters corresponding to different plots
fig2.py is the graphing code of Fig. 5, 7 and 9, which requires adjusting the parameters corresponding to different graphs.
fig3.py is the graphing code of Fig. 10
